Getting started:

1) 'File' and 'Open Map Image' to open an image that map graphs can be created with.

Next...

2) 'File' and 'Open XML Graph' to open existing map graphs saved as XML.

Or...

3) 'Edit' and 'Insert Node' to begin creating a map graph by inserting nodes.

To ensure that you can successfully create a map graph you must adhere to the following
guidelines:

-Place at least two nodes and one edge.
-Give at least two nodes a name other than 'Choice Point'.
-Connect all nodes on the graph with at least one edge.
-Ensure that the graph is fully connected (see help for further explanation).
